Code to help plan for trips
This code is used to allow easier encoding of tiktok information for the Japan Trip
It must create a dataframe with the following details: Region, Activity, Cost, and Link
The code must also be saved to an excel file for sheets uploading.
Furthermore, it must be editable for future addition to the compilation
Lastly, I also want it to be able to create an itinerary for the chosen code. This will use additional time and date variables.
